# Boostrap Components Used

For this assignment, the following from Bootstrap was used:

* Navbar
    * Removed the Search bar and extra links
    * Made the links disabled on the home page so users have to click on the "Welcome" button to access the page
* Two cards was used:
    * On the home page, the first card is used to enter the site, and there is a button within that card
    * The color of the button was changed to a different color along with the background
    * The second card is for the quote on the Careers page
* The background color of the home page was also changed with the override code for that one page
* Columns were used on the three pages
    * Removed extra columns and adjusted how large each column could be 
    * Made the content in the center of the page
