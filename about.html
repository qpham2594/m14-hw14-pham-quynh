                <div class=" p-4 col-md-4"> Hi, hello, welcome! <br> You're either here because you are actually interested in who I am as a person, or you just want to be nosy, or because you have nothing else to do...or because you have to! <br> <br>
                     I am an introvert at heart, but I can still socialize and be an extrovert when I need to! I enjoy meeting new people and making friends, but I do need a couple days to recharge after that. <br> <br>
                     If you want to contact me, don't hesitate to reach out! <br> <br>
                     You can find me on LinkedIn, or check out my repository on Github!
                </div>
                <div class=" p-4 col-md-5">Fun facts about me: <br> <br> I love to dance, and it doesn't matter what type of dancing. Right now, I am really into swing, so I put myself in three difference dance classes for three hours straight every Thursday.
                 Why? Who knows? I just felt like it, and so here I am, almost five months later, still taking three dance classes back to back! <br> <br> Alcohol is not my friend, I feel pretty sick after a sip or two, so I don't even bother with it.
                 But don't worry, I don't need alcohol to loosen up on the dance floor. Most of the time, people can't even tell I am sober!<br> <br>
                 I like to grow different plants, and this year, I have turned small backyard into a small garden. Somehow, I killed a succulent, but I managed to have my veggies alive. I think it's just an ADHD thing, failing at the simplest things, but exceeding in the things that others find difficult because they just make more sense.</div>
