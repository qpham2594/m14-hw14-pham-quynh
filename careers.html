        <h2> Career Goals </h2> <br>
        Since I won't graduate until next Spring, I don't want to say I have an exact path of career goals right now. I think we're in a time where everything changes constantly and so I don't want to set a goal what might not be happening a year from now.
        I want to be open-minded and seize whatever opportunities that I see when that time comes. <br> <br>
        As of right now, I have a friend who started a non-profit organization and I would love to join her team once everything is finalized, and of course, I would be done with the program by then. 
        I am also open to the idea of working for another non-profit organization - I think working for people with a goal in mind of doing something good for our generation or future generations would give me the drive and the enthusiasm to do my job. <br> <br>
        I don't think I would mind working for the government either, but overall, I won't know what jobs will be available by next year, but I am positive that whatever job I choose to do, I will do my best at that job.
