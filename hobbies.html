                <h2> Hobbies </h2>
                I have too many hobbies because I want to do everything, and be excelent at everything. Often enough, however, I hyped myself so much mentally that I get mentally exhausted by the time I finish one project. Then, I move on to the next hobby. <br>
                 <br> With that said, here are my current hobbies: swing dancing, cooking, baking, gardening, and propagating my plants.

                <h2> Interests </h2>
                Right now, I am interesting in planning a trip to either Vietnam or somewhere in Europe, but everything is too expensive for someone like me who is unemployed at the moment.
                On an unrelated topic to that interest, I am also interested in learning to be an entrepreneur. I listen to a lot of ADHD podcasts, and some of the expert guests have mentioned that ADHD people tend to be very good entrepreneurs - so I have been looking into that.
                That thought is a little scary though, so it might be on the back of my mind for a while before I do anything with it. 
                Another interest of mine right now is to absorb everything that I am learning right now in coding and programming so that I can really expand my creativity and what I can do. 
                I stumbled across this video of creating a website with 20 lines of CSS or less, and watching it gave me the adrenaline that I want to do the same. So that's something I want to do eventually as well.
